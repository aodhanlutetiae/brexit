# brexit

These files relate to an analysis of a Brexit petition to parliament that ran briefly in Jan-Feb 2019. The petition suggested that the UK government "Offer the Republic of Ireland full UK membership so they can rejoin the Union". It was later removed after the parliament's petition committee said it had received complaints.

The repo contains:

-- Two JSON downloads of the petition data taken before the petition was removed.
-- Two python files that show the code used to analyse the data
-- One .csv file (also from the petitions website) that lists every petition ever launched with Brexit in the title (555).

All of this material was used in the following article: https://newcrocus.com/brexit-petition-2019/
